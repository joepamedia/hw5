# Work Day Planner
This is a 9am-5pm planner that a user can interact with to plan their day. The user can input a task into an alotted time slot row and save it to their local storage. When the alotted time slot is green, that means it is a future event. When it is grey that means the event has passed. Finally when it is red, it shows event is currently ongoing which is based off of the specific time. This website was made with HTML, CSS powered by jQuery and JavaScript. The Moment library is also incorporated to update the current date and time.
